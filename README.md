# Backend Blueprint: Feature Foundations: Weight: 1

**Project over - took place from Oct 20, 2025 12:00 AM to Oct 27, 2025 12:00 AM**
**Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)**

## In a nutshell…

## Overview

 1. The Airbnb Clone is a backend application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb.
 
 2. It will provide a RESTful API (or GraphQL) that handles user accounts, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing.
 
 3. This documentation phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the system, covering everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications before a single line of code is written.

### Learning Objectives

**By completing this documentation project, you will learn how to:**

 - Translate project requirements into a structured list of features and functionalities.
 
 - Model system interactions visually using Use Case Diagrams to identify actors and their goals.
 
 - Articulate user needs by writing clear User Stories that guide development from a user-centric perspective.
 
 - Map data movement through the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to understand how information is processed.
 
 - Detail specific processes with Flowcharts to define logical sequences and decision points.
 
 - Write precise technical specifications that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.
 
 - Utilize diagramming tools like Draw.io to create professional and clear technical diagrams.

#### Key Concepts

 - Backend Architecture: The structure of the server-side application, including routers, controllers, models, and services.
 
 - RESTful API Design: Creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
 
 - Data Modeling: Designing the database schema (e.g., using SQL like PostgreSQL or NoSQL) to efficiently store and relate data (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.).
 
 - Authentication & Authorization: Implementing mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity (AuthN) and control access to resources (AuthZ).
 
 - Payment Gateway Integration: Securely processing payments using third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.
 
 - Documentation: The practice of creating clear, maintainable, and comprehensive guides and specifications for a software project.

#### Tools and Libraries

 - Draw.io / Diagrams.net: A free, online diagramming tool for creating Use Case Diagrams, DFDs, and Flowcharts.
 
 - Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting the documentation repository.
 
 - Markdown: A lightweight markup language for formatting the README.md and other documentation files.
 
 - Node.js & Express.js (Potential): Likely JavaScript runtime and web framework for building the backend.
 
 - Database (Potential): PostgreSQL ( relational) or MongoDB (non-relational).
 
 - Authentication (Potential): bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWTs.
 
 - Payments (Potential): Stripe API SDK.

#### Real-World Use Case

1. This documentation directly simulates the initial phases of a real-world software development lifecycle (SDLC) at any tech company.

2. Before engineers start coding, Product Managers, System Analysts, and Technical Leads collaborate to produce exactly these kinds of artifacts:

3. Product Requirements Doc (PRD): The list of features (Task 0).

4. System Design Mockups: Use Case and Data Flow diagrams (Tasks 1 & 3).

5. Agile/Scrum Backlog Items: User Stories (Task 2).

6. Technical Specifications: Detailed API and requirement docs (Task 5). This process ensures everyone is aligned, reduces development errors, and provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team.
